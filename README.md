# Narrative Generator Component

This repository contains a prototype implementation of the **Narrative Generator** for our research project _A Multi-Level Explainability Framework for BDI Multi Agent Systems_. You access directly the deployed web application **[here](https://yan-elena.github.io/agent-explanation/)** without installing anything.

## A Multi-Level Explainability Framework for Engineering and Understanding BDI Agent Systems

The primary levels of abstraction identified in this study are as follows:
- The **Implementation Level**: a detailed narrative closely related to the Agent and Multi-Agent Systems for debugging and testing.
- The **Design Level**: a level that describes the agent behaviour regardless of its implementation for analysis and verification.
- The **Domain Level**: a high-level narrative that explains the behaviour with reference to the domain and requirements of the system - *(work in progress)*.

## Usage

Following the instructions presented in the **[Logger Component](https://github.com/yan-elena/agent-logging)** to generate the `log files` of your JaCaMo project.
Once you have the log files, you can upload them to the Home Page.

At this point, you can navigate through the generated narratives at multiple levels for each agent in the system.

## Examples
You can also use the example log files in the `/examples` folder to visualize the result and try the multi-level explanation.
