# Agent Explanation

Explanation component for _a multi-level framework for BDI Multi-Agent Systems_.

Agent-Explanation is a repository that provides the explanation component for inspecting and explaining the behaviour of a BDI multi-agent system. The framework's objective is to provide a multi-level vision of explainability that encompasses both low-level aspects for debugging purposes for developers and high-level aspects for exploring and understanding the system's behaviour for end-users.

You can find the deployed web application **[here](https://yan-elena.github.io/agent-explanation/)** so you can use it without installing anything.

For generating explanations concerning your agent system, you must use the **[logging component](https://github.com/yan-elena/agent-logging)** of the framework and generate log files.
Once the log files have been obtained, they can be loaded into the web application.

You can also use the example files in the `/examples` folder to visualise the result and try the multi-level explanation.
